Description: Cleans biological sequences massively, quickly, without errors and 
 without internet connection.  Biological sequences cleaning is performed by 
 aligning the forward and / or revers primers or ends of cloning vectors with the sequences 
 to be cleaned. After the alignment, new subsequences are generated without biological fragment 
 not desired by the user.
